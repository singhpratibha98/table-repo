here we are using some html tag to perform some operation :-
1) title tag - defines the title of the document.
2) table tag- An HTML table consists of one <table> element and one or more <tr>, <th>, and <td> elements. The <tr> element defines a table row, the <th> element defines a table header, and the <td> element defines a table cell.
3) cellspacing -Cell spacing is the space between each cell. By default the space is set to 2 pixels.
4) colspan - The colspan attribute defines the number of columns a table cell should span.
5) image tag -The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages.
6) anchor tag - The <a> tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another. The most important attribute of the <a> element is the href ...
7) paragraph tag -  It defines a paragraph .Browsers automatically add a single blank line before and after each <p> element.
